# Audit Reports Repository

Hey there! 🕵️‍♂️
Welcome to my Audits Repository! 
This is my auditing experience so far, Below are the codebases and my findings.💻💎
My Goal is to keep auditing, keep expanding this repo, and maybe even discover a few lines of code that tell jokes.
Who knows, maybe we'll find some bits and bytes of humor along the way!😄🔍
